# Metrics to differntiate the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) sets
This repository contains the implementation of the metrics, namely **Softmax-based entropy, Coverage Ratio, Coverage Distance**, that are designed to measure the **protection level of in-distribution sub-manifolds in the feature space** by a given OOD set. The related paper is published in [ECAI 2020](http://ecai2020.eu/) and presented in [NeurIPS-Workshop on Safety and Robustness in Decision Making](https://sites.google.com/view/neurips19-safe-robust-workshop), 2019. This paper is also available at <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08650.pdf>.
